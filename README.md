# embedded-Ethernet-networks
This project aims to make an embedded-Ethernet-network between 2 tiva-c TM4C123GH6PM microcontrollers by using 
external Ethernet controller ENC28j60 and a tcp/ip stack using LWIP open source stack but there are some modification 
and not all the apps or the modules are implemented, finally the app used is very simple where one host send a buffer of 800 byte 
to the anther host every 1 sec.This is only the first version, and will be there a next version.

Before the end of November
